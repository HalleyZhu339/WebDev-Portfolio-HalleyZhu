<p><b>How I Applied Design Thinking to My Website</b></p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Empathize:</b> This is a portfolio website. The users need to know about me a bit more on this website.
        I imagined that I was the audience who was visiting someone's portfolio website, and which key information
        I wanted to know. Then I put this kind of information on my website.</li>
    <li><b>Define:</b> The core problem of designing a portfolio website is how to introduce myself in a brief and
        effective way. I tried to put important information instead of trivial details on my website. Also, I showcased
        three classic examples of my assignments and projects on my website.</li>
    <li><b>Ideate:</b> I generated many ideas to solve the defined problem. I am a science student, so I planned to put
        one chemistry assignment and one physics assignment on my Portfolio Section. Besides, I am interested in environmental
        protection, especially solving the problem of water pollution. Thus, I planned to show my initiative to the sixth
        UN Global Goal - Clean Water and Sanitation.</li>
    <li><b>Prototype:</b> I chose the client Kai for my client project when I took Intro to Web Development course. Kai loves
        nature and cares about environmental protection. The web page I designed for Kai is the prototye of my UN Global Goals
        page on my portfolio website.</li>
